## Example

# Goals for the Paper #1

Narrative: Erosion + bluff at (different spot of North Slope of Alaska)

Problem: Lack of direct data to monitor the shoreline evolution, thus ICESat-2

1. Alg. ID shoreline profile
2. Alg to measure shoreline evolution
3. Alg to expand to North Slope

* Download granules for ATL03, ATL06, ATL08 and ATL11
* Creating notebooks to be used in the future
* Create maps showing the positions of the tracks
* Understand how these files work and how to use it

# Proposal

## Research Questions:
(RQ1) What are the seasonal and inter-annual coastal landscape changes and coastal erosion patterns in Arctic Alaska from 2018 to the present? 

(RQ2) How much coastal bluff retreat, barrier island erosion, vegetation loss and permafrost collapse have there been from 2018 to the present? 

(RQ3) How are permafrost collapses, coastal erosion, and bluff retreats driven by changes in air and ocean temperature, wave action, seasonal storminess, and sea/land ice presence? 

(RQ4) What are the potential impacts of climate change to coastal erosion in the Arctic under future emission scenarios considering physical, mechanical and thermal processes? 

 ## Objectives:
* (OBJ1) Evaluate and validate ICESat-2 data for monitoring and quantifying Arctic coastal landscape and coastal erosion changes. 

* (OBJ2) Improve quantifications of seasonal and inter-annual Arctic landscape and erosion changes from 2018 to the present. 

* (OBJ3) Implement and validate an advanced Earth system modeling framework capable of simulating Arctic storm surges, waves, wave-ice interaction, near-shore coastal hazards, thermal and mechanical coastal erosion, and coastal landscape transformation in the Arctic. 

* (OBJ4) Integrate ICESat-2 data with the advanced Earth system modeling framework to investigate and improve our mechanistic understanding of observed changes and trends in Arctic coastal erosion. 

* (OBJ5) Gain a better understanding of the relevant physical drivers of coastal change and their influence on Arctic landscape changes. 

* (OBJ6) Advance the current understanding of the sensitivity of Arctic coastal change to climate change under different future emissions scenarios.
